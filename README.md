# Cake.Json
A set of aliases for http://cakebuild.net to help with JSON Serialization and manipulation.

![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/redth/Cake.Json)

You can easily reference Cake.Json directly in your build script via a cake addin:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.Json
#addin nuget:?package=Newtonsoft.Json&version=11.0.2
```

NOTE: It's very important at this point in time to specify the Newtonsoft.Json package *and* the version _11.0.2_ for it.
